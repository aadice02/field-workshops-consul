.contents[
* Create isolated environments in the shared cluster and apply the required service access restrictions for authenticated users, by groups.
* Delegate per-tenant admins the capability to manage policies for their own services within the defined scope.
* Remove the need for coordination among teams to prevent conflict for service names
